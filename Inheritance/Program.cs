				The class whose members are inherited is called the base class. 
				The class that inherits the members of the base class is called the derived class.

						Override -	The override modifier is required to extend or modify 
									the abstract or virtual implementation of an inherited method, 
									property, indexer, or event.
						Virtual  -	The virtual keyword is used to modify a method, property, indexer, or event declaration 
									and allow for it to be overridden in a derived class. 
									For example, this method can be overridden by any class that inherits it
									When a virtual method is invoked, 
									the run-time type of the object is checked for an overriding member

						You cannot override a non-virtual or static method. 
						The overridden base method must be virtual, abstract, or override.

			// Creating and Using Abstract Classes

			/*
			  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/abstract
			  
			 Virtual methods have an implementation and provide the derived classes with the option of overriding it. 
			 Abstract methods do not provide an implementation and force the derived classes to override the method.

			 So, abstract methods have no actual code in them, and subclasses HAVE TO override the method. 

			 Virtual methods can have code, which is usually a default implementation of something, 
			 and any subclasses CAN override the method using the override modifier and provide a custom implementation.

			/*
			
				An interface defines a contract. 
				Any class or struct that implements that contract must provide

				Used For Dependency Injection (Advanced Topic)

				Used When you want two fundamentally differnt classes to act Polymorphically (share behavior)

			// ************************************* Part 5 *************************************** 
			// Diffference between Interfaces and Abstract Classes

			/*
				https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface-in-c-sharp/

				An Abstract class is a way to achieve the abstraction in C#. 
				An Abstract class is never intended to be instantiated directly. 
				This class must contain at least one abstract method, which is marked by the keyword or modifier abstract in the class definition. 
				The Abstract classes are typically used to define a base class in the class hierarchy.

				Generally, we use abstract class at the time of inheritance.
					A user must use the override keyword before the method which is declared as abstract in child class, 
						the abstract class is used to inherit in the child class.
					It can contains constructors.
					It can implement functions with non-Abstract methods.      <---- Signifant difference
					It cannot support multiple inheritance.
					It can’t be static.

				Like a class, Interfaces can have methods, properties, events, and indexers as its members. 
				But interfaces will contain only the declaration of the members. 

				The implementation of interface’s members will be given by the class who implements the interface implicitly or explicitly.	
			
				Advantage of Interface:
					It is used to achieve loose coupling.
					It is used to achieve total abstraction.
					To achieve component-based programming
					To achieve multiple inheritance and abstraction.
					Interfaces add a plug and play like architecture into applications.
